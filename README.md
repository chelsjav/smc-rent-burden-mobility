# üî¨ Key Findings
The study‚Äôs findings reveal significant trends in rent burden and mobility within San Mateo County over the past decade. While it was expected that affordability would worsen, the overall rent burden actually declined, with the most noticeable decreases occurring in the southern part of the county. However, this trend does not necessarily indicate improved affordability but may instead reflect rising household incomes, demographic shifts, or the displacement of lower-income residents. Rent burden fluctuated over time, peaking in 2015, declining until 2019, and rising again after 2020, likely due to economic shifts and post-pandemic financial pressures. Despite the observed decline, a significant proportion of households continue to allocate more than 50% of their income to rent, highlighting ongoing affordability challenges.

Mobility trends further emphasize the affordability crisis, particularly among lower-income and immigrant communities. Foreign-born residents showed increasing mobility until 2019, but their movement declined sharply after 2020, suggesting greater affordability constraints and the impact of stricter immigration policies. Racial disparities in mobility were also evident, with Latine mobility declining, possibly due to economic or housing challenges, while Asian mobility increased, particularly within the county and surrounding areas. White mobility peaked mid-decade but later declined, whereas Black mobility remained relatively low but showed slight growth. Geographic shifts in mobility patterns align with rent burden trends, as mobility increased in high-rent burden areas, particularly in northern and eastern regions of the county, reinforcing the link between displacement and affordability pressures.

The correlation analysis supports the relationship between rent burden and mobility, with a strong negative correlation (-0.92) between rent burden and staying in the same residence, meaning that households experiencing higher rent burdens are significantly more likely to relocate. Furthermore, different types of mobility (intra-county, inter-state, and international migration) were highly correlated, indicating that factors influencing local moves also affect long-distance relocations. The strongest relationship was observed among long-distance movers, with international migrants (R¬≤ = 0.84) and out-of-state movers (R¬≤ = 0.75) being the most affected by extreme rent burdens. These findings suggest that those facing the greatest financial strain are often forced to relocate outside of San Mateo County entirely.

From a policy perspective, the decline in rent burden may not necessarily signal affordability improvements but rather the displacement of lower-income households. The post-2020 decline in foreign-born mobility raises concerns about increasing economic precarity and housing barriers. To address these challenges, policymakers should focus on stabilizing rent, expanding affordable housing, and strengthening tenant protections to prevent further displacement. Without targeted interventions, San Mateo County is likely to continue experiencing housing instability, growing economic inequality, and long-term demographic shifts driven by affordability pressures.
